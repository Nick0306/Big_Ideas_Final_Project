# Big_Ideas_Final_Project - Team NRT
This is the repository for the final project in Professor Arjun Chandrasekhar's CMPINF 0010 course. We are tasked with finding the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based on datasets from the WPRDC database, and using the Pandas data visualization library of the Python language to communicate our results.

For our project, we picked three factors that we thought were most important for the determination of a good neighborhood. The Pittsburgh SNAP Census datasets (2010) had all the information we needed, indexed by neighborhood. The factors we chose were transportation, health/safety, and housing. For each of these factors, we broke them down further into more variables (for example, transportation was split into public transportation, driver-friendliness, and walking/biking). We then used survey data (we received around 100 responses) to weigh these variables relative to their importance.

## Data Sets:
These datasets are all from the Pittsburgh SNAP Census data from 2010. Each of these datasets was indexed by neighborhood
### Safety/Health
* Public Safety and different offenses per neighborhood: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/204f63f4-296f-4f1d-bbdd-946b183fa5a0
### Transportation
* Transportation methods per neighborhood: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/5d61b60b-bd25-4c33-8420-e31a9135ec6e
### Housing
* Populations, housing (vacant/occupied homes): https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/9890875b-c1d1-4e64-8fc9-a4a8dc433745

# Findings:
After adding up our scores in each of the subcategories, we reached our three winners: Arlington Heights, S
